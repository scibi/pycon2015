The clues have led you to giant caterpillar smoking pipe. It inhaled loudly and hold its breath. After counting to 10, when you were sure it will soon suffocate, caterpillar has blown loudly a big, sweety smelling cloud right into your nostrils. You unwillingly breathed in, and in a moment you felt dizzy. The world spinned around you, and unfortunately it stood like that. Everything you saw was reversed. And than the caterpillar has spoken.


You hear a voice in your head saying: I have exactly three houndred and one legs.
